# Bank Account Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) Analysis project aimed at enhancing fraud detection mechanisms for new account applicants in the banking sector. The project leverages statistical and machine learning models to identify and predict fraudulent activities efficiently.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze factors contributing to fraud in new account applications and develop a robust model to predict potential fraud.

## Data
The dataset includes detailed applicant information, account activities, and fraud status.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data handling.
- **Scikit-Learn**: To implement machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **SMOTE**: For handling imbalanced datasets.

## Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **SVM**
- **Random Forest**
- **KNN**
- **Naive Bayes**
- Models were evaluated using accuracy, ROC-AUC score, precision, recall, and F1-score.
