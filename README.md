# Bank Account Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis and predictive modeling for detecting fraudulent activities in new bank account applications. The project uses machine learning to improve fraud detection and prevention strategies, enhancing the bank's ability to safeguard its financial operations.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze factors contributing to fraud in new account applications and develop a robust model to predict potential fraud. This assists in refining fraud detection processes and minimizing financial risks.

## Data
The data consists of new account applicant information, including both fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases. Detailed analysis has revealed that only a small fraction of the applications are fraudulent.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas/NumPy**: For data handling.
- **Scikit-Learn**: To implement machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **SMOTE**: For handling imbalanced datasets.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/Fraud_Detection.git
cd Fraud_Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- Models were evaluated using accuracy, ROC-AUC score, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
To run the analysis and model training scripts, navigate to the project directory and execute:
```bash
python fraud_analysis.py
```
